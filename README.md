# PICLib
I will create several libraries for the PIC18F13K22. 

I still have to add 9th bit transmission functionality, addressing, autobaudrate, breakcharacter, and autobaudrate.

SPI is mostly done. I still need to add interrupt based functions. I also need to consider How to implement priority based interrupts.
